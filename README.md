SystemOfLinearEquation-Solver
======================

**Overview**

This is a cross entropy method based system of linear equations solver, for AX = B, where 2D matrix A and vector B are given, *where number of variables given are greater than number of given equations*. Since it uses probabilistic approach, it gives approximate solution. You can also find it on pastebin ,http://pastebin.com/Q4c73Kdi
